# passwordgen
THIS APPLICATION WILL GENERATE A NEW PASSWORD BASED ON USER SELECTION: 

EACH INPUT IS A PROMPT THAT WILL CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF THE PASSWORD THAT IS BEING GENERATED 
USERS ARE ABLE TO SELECT IF THEY WANT UPPER CASE LETTER, NUMBERS OR SPECIAL CHARACTERS ADDED TO THEIR PASSWORD. IF A USER DECLINES ALL OPTIONS, ONLY LOWER CASE LETTERS WILL BE USED. THE LENGTH OF THE PASSWORD IS DETERMED WHEN A USER ENTERS A NUMBER INTO THE TEXT FIELD. 

PASSWORDS ARE GENERATED USING A RANDOM NUMBER TO PULL ELEMENTS OUT OF AN ARRAY OF CHARACTERS
